	  	<a href=math1110syllabus.pdf>Probability and Finite Math</a> (Spring 2020, Spring 2019)<br>
	  	Topics covered include counting principles, probability, random variable, statistics, Markov chains, logic, and game theory. The course was not coordinated and I was responsible for my own curriculum, materials, and examinations. Linked are most of my typed lecture notes which can be found here: <a href="1110notes">Probability and Finite Math Lecture Notes</a>.

	  	Topics covered are those of a normal first course in calculus including the precise definition of a limit. I taught this course with a traditional lecture style in 2017, but used a flippled classroom/inquiry based learning model in 2018 and 2019.
